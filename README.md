While participating in the coding moon challenge we have been working on a web application interested in  protecting bees from hornets attack without neither affecting the environment with toxic products nor killing hornets. That's why our project named "BEE THE CHANGE" was the interface that connected between both farmers , and donators (associations) , this web application will be able to alert farmers the moment a hornet attacks the farm once a sensor detect their activity, these sensors work with AI that we developed to detect hornets from different position and be able to recognize them . While the farmer gets notified he will agree about launching an alarm to alert bees and a chemical product that hornets product them selves while calling each other because they attack in mass that's why they will get trapped in an other place , and encouraging farms to not kill farmers we will give them opportunity to sell them and get bounces that can converts them in buying other sensors or to get more aliments or products for their bees and hives , so our web app could be their refuge .
